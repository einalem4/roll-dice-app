# Roll Dice App

## Overview

The Roll Dice App is a simple yet engaging application that allows users to simulate rolling a dice. Each press of the roll button generates a random number between 1 and 6, mimicking the experience of rolling a physical dice. This app is developed using Flutter, a powerful UI toolkit that enables the creation of natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The programming language used is Dart, known for its efficiency in building fast, multi-platform applications.
